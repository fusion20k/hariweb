                <h2>6. How We Process Translation Data</h2>
                <p>When you enable Hari on a webpage, the extension reads the text content of that page and sends the relevant text to our translation infrastructure, which uses the Lara API to generate Tagalog translations.</p>

                <h3>1. Supabase</h3>

                <h3>2. Stripe</h3>
                <p>We use Stripe as our payment processor. Stripe processes your payment information, including card details, in accordance with Stripe's own privacy policy. We receive limited information from Stripe, such as the last four digits of the card, card brand, and subscription status.</p>

                <h3>3. Lara API</h3>
                <p>We use Lara API solely to perform text translation. Page text and associated translation parameters are sent to Lara API to generate Tagalog translations, which are returned to your browser.</p>

                <h3>4. Infrastructure Providers</h3>
                <p>We may use hosting, storage, and logging providers that process technical data necessary to deliver and secure the Service.</p>

                <p class="note">Each third-party provider processes data on our behalf under appropriate contractual safeguards.</p>
